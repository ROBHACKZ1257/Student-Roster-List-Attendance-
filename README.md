# Student-Roster-List-Attendance-

_**On the student roster list attendance A teacher will create an account that will be rendered into the datatbase so that the teacher's credentials are valid if not then they would have to create one.**_

_**After they successfully created their credentials and it's in the database they can go ahead and sign in the same credentials only that this time they can simply log in.**_

## The Code I have done:

_**I created a schema for student so that the details about the student can be rendered in the client side.**_

_**My favorite method would be the create and delete method.**_

_**My favorite react component that I find interesting are the routes in the route file and app.jsx file.**_

_**Buttons I added so when the user clicks on the button it will redirect them to another page.**_


# My experience

_**My biggest challenge was routing the pages so they can be able to navigate from one page to another since I am used to basic HTML and javascript more than MERN stack.**_

_**The takeaway I learned from this is take everything one at a time step by step, for example what steps did Jade do in order for his backend server to work properly so that his client side can display things the way he wants.**_
